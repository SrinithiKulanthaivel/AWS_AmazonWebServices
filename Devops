Devops - where we create our application and deploy it in the cloud.
  CICD pipeline :-
  CI - Contineous Integration  - Contineously running our tests and packaging. 
  CD - Contineous Deployement  - Contineously Deploying to our test environment.
  CD - Contineous Delivery     - Contineously deploy to production.

  Using CICD - we can contineously made changes to our application. and AWS follows below four steps for these
        AWS CodeCommit - Private source control (Git)
        AWS CodePipeline - Orchestrate CICD pipelines
        AWS CodeBuild  - Build and TestCode (application package or containers)
        AWS CodeDeploy - Automate Deployment (EC2, ECS, ElasticBeanstalk, Lambda, etc)

  Devops - IAAC (Infrastructure As A Code) 
    Generally we used to create instance and deploy our application multiple times, and each time it involves the below process
      CreateTemplate   ----> Provision Server ----> Install Software   ---> config Software ---> Deploy APP
    IAAC - treat infrastructure the same way as application code.
    Track infrastructure changes over time
    Bring repeatability into your infrastructure.
    Two key parts
      Infrastructure Provisioning:
          Provision compute, db, storage and network
          Open source cloud neutral - terraform
          AWS Service - CloudFormation
      Configuration Management
          Install right software on provisioned resource

AWS CloudFormation - Use template to create the resource. using it we can easily create multiple resource , multiple no.of times by simply executing the scirpt. (Json / Yaml)
  Important template elements 
      {
        AWSTemplateFormatVersion : "version date".
        Description : "Json String",
        Metadata : {"provies metadata"},
        Parameter : {"used to provide runtime values eg: EC2 instance size small/large/medium"},
        Resources : {"Need to mention all the required resource to be created"},
        Mappings : {"Helps us to map key value pair based on environments"},
        Outputs : {"Return vlaues from executions"}
      }
