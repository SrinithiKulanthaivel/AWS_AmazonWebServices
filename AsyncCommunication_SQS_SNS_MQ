Synchronize Communication - it will execute in an order. eg : sender  ---> intermediate Service   ---> receiver
  in the Synch communication it will execute in the order and if the receiver went down, then the message will be lost. 
Asynchronize Communication - It will execute randomly through queues. eg : Sender ----> queue ------> receiver
  in the Asynch Communication, the sender don't need to bother about receiver.Message stored in queue and once the receiver is up. it will fetch from queue.
  Two types of Asynch communication, 
    SQS - Simple Queue Service.
    SNS - Simple Notification Service.
    Amazon MQ = SQS + SNS

SQS - Simple Queue Service
    Reliable, Scalable, fully-managed message queuing service.
    High availability
    Unlimited Scaling - Auto scale to process billions of messages
    Low cost
    SQS - is of two types:
      Standard Queue 
      FIFO Queue
    Standard Queue :
      Unlimited throughput
      But no guarantee of ordering 
      And no guarantee of exactly-once processing but guarantee atlest once delivery.
    FIFO Queue :
      First-In-First-Out delivery
      Exactly-Once processing but throughput is lower.
    
 SNS - Simple Notification Service. - similar to Kafka
    Publish-Subscribe (Pub_sub) paradigm
    broadcast Asynchronours event notifications
    Simple Process :
      Create an SNS Topic
      Subscribers can register for a Topic
      when SNS Topic receives an event notification, it is broadcast to all Subscribers.
