Virtual Private Cloud - VPC
    An isolated network in AWS cloud. All the within a VPC is isolated to another all other VPCs.
    Secure access from unauthorized 
    Enable secure connection between the cloud resources.


Subnet : Public Subnet & Private Subet.

public ----------------> ELB  ----------------> EC2 Instance  -------------------> Database

Public - public
ELB ---- Public 
EC2 ---- Private
DB ----- Private

The resource which are public will be placed under public subnet.
The resource which are private will be placed under private subnet.(resources which are inside VPC only can access EC2 / DB)
But resource in public subnet can talk to resources in private subnet.


AWS   -----> VPC , VPC,...    -----> region  ---> diff Availability zone   ----> subnets 

Each VPC created under a specific region
Each subnet created in a availability zone.
example : VPC - us-east1  => Subnet in us-east-a1 or us-east-a2 or ...

Router and Router table : route tables are used for routing. 

Router - like cable in the TV channel route table will redirect us.

user  -----> route1   ----> route2 ------> route3 ------> site.

Each router has a set of rules, that helps to deticate it path to the destinated IP address. 
Route tables are associated with VPCs and subnets.
Each route table consiste so set of rules called routes. 
Each rule has a destination and target. 

Route rule for subnets :
rule 1 --> 172.31.0.0/16     ----> Local      ----> Local routing      (private)
rule 2 --> 0.0.0.0/0        -----> igw-123456   -->Internet routing    (public)

Public Subnet : route through internet gateway (igw)
Allow subnet to internet 
Allow internet to subnet

Private Subnet : route through Network Address Translation (nat)
Not allow internet to subnet.
Might allow subnet to internet. (using NAT)


NAT - Network Address Translation 
Incase 
    - allow instance in private subnets to download software updates. or 
    - instance in private subnet connect privately with other instance in AWS

using three method :
    NAT Gateway - Managed Service
    NAT Instance - install a EC2 instance with specific NAT AMI and gateway.
    Egress-only Internet Gateway - Ipv6 - allow only outbound traffic from subnet to internet.


NACL - Network Access Control List
  Usually security Groups (SG) control traffic to a specific resource in a subnet, but if we want to Stop a traffic before entering to the subnet is NACL.

  user ----> NACL -----> Security Group in SubnetNet -----> resource. 

NACL provides Stateless firewall at subnet level. 
Default NACL allows all inbound and outbound traffic
Custom NACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic
Rules have a priority number 
    Lower number => Higher Priority.
