Elastic BeanStalk - PaaS (need to care only about application)
    Simplest way to deploy and scale our application in web. Like end - end web application management. 
    Usually we need to create EC2 and then add LB and then add Auto Scaling.... in manual way. But it simply the process.
    It supports Java, ruby, .net, node.js, php, go and Docker apps.
    It takes care of Auto Scaling, LB, platform updates, Health monitoring etc. 
  Features: 
   * Application - app + version + environment + configuration
   * App Version - version of deployed code (stored in S3)
   * Environment - Different environment  we can deploy differnt version

AutoScaling Component. 
    Vertical Scaling - Increase the size -> o -  O
    Horizontal Scaling - Increase the number -> 0 - 0000
  AutoScaling Component : EC2 instance and AMI 
  AutoScaling Group : Min , Max and desire size of ASG
  AutoScaling Policy : When - Need to increase/ decrease based on CPU, usage 

ServerLess : AWS Lambda + Lambda function  + API Gateway 
    Serverless means not like there is no server, some server will run in the background but we dont need to take care of it. we dont care about infrastructure. 
    Payfor what we used like no.of request, duration of request, memory consumed.
